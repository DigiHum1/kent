Born in Steventon, near Basingstoke, Hampshire, in 1775, Jane Austen often visited Kent, the birthplace of her father, and the long-term residence of her brother Edward Austen Knight, with whom she stayed at Rowling House and later at the magnificent Godmersham Park. During these extended visits, Austen travelled to many other destinations in Kent for social calls or leisure outings.

During visits to her brother Edward Austen Knight between 1794 and 1813, Austen frequently took day trips to Canterbury. In addition to making social calls, Austen enjoyed the other attractions Canterbury had to offer, including visits to the Cathedral, shopping, concerts, and balls.
