Kent is not only the garden of England, it is also the first landing site of Christianity in Britain. St Augustine began his mission to convert the Britons to Christianity in Canterbury, although he was not the first practicing Christian in the city. Queen Bertha first celebrated the mass at St Martin’s church around 580 AD. This makes St Martin’s priory, in the city of Canterbury, the first and oldest place of Christian worship in Britain. Kent is known for a number of famous and celebrated churches and cathedrals, but parochial Kent also includes some hidden gems with just as much to explore as the great Canterbury Cathedral. These churches are enveloped by rich local folklore, and often played major roles in the history of Britain.

 A short walk from the city of Canterbury, Fordwich boasts the title of the smallest town in England, and contains many beautiful examples of historic architecture. Its church [ St Mary the Virgin](stmary-fordwich) is of course amongst these examples, but within its tranquil walls lies a possibly spectacular monument. 

The church of [St John the Baptist](stjohn-smallhythe) in the village of Small Hythe (a village with a curious and unexpected history of its own) holds many precious relics, including the grave of [Ellen Terry]( /20c/20c-terry-biography), one of the most famous thespians of the modern age.
