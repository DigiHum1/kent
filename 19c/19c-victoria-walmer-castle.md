Brief Excerpt: “It is the most delightful sea-residence to be found anywhere, particularly for children. They can be out all day, on the ramparts and platforms quite dry, and the beautiful gardens and wood are enclosed and sheltered from the severe gales of wind.” The Duke of Wellington to Sir Robert Peel in a letter written from the castle on 26th October 1842 [from the Letters of Queen Victoria, Vol 1, ed Arthur Christopher Benson and Viscount Esher, online at Project Gutenberg]
