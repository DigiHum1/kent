_'It is the most delightful sea-residence to be found anywhere, particularly for children. They can be out all day, on the ramparts and platforms quite dry, and the beautiful gardens and wood are enclosed and sheltered from the severe gales of wind.'_ The Duke of Wellington to Sir Robert Peel in a letter written from the castle on 26th October 1842

Queen Victoria, Prince Albert and their two young children stayed at the Duke of Wellington’s residence, [Walmer Castle](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/walmer-castle-and-gardens/), in 1842. She records in her diary:
_We have settled to go to Walmer Castte on the 10th, for 10 days, as there is still scarlet fever at Brighton. The Duke of Wellington has kindly lent us Walmer. Its situation is charming, & one can see quantites of ships, which one never does at Brighton, & it has the great advantage of being private, but the house is very small, which however, will be rather fine._[^ref1]

The royal party travelled in three carriages, changing horses at Blacksheath, Dartford, Gravesend, Rochester, Sittingbourne, Ospringe, Canterbury & Sandwich during the 103 mile journey. The Queen read despatches, whilst the Prince read St Simon. She notes that the "The road was very hilly, but we came along quickly." The Duke of Wellington met them near Sandwich, accompanying them for a while before riding on to receive them at Walmer. It was dark when they arrived and the Queen observes that: 
_Most of the rooms are very oddly shaped, from forming part of a circle, the Castle being, in fact, a large Martello Tower. The Nursery is over the Moat, of course, connected, as there is one long passage, going all along, rooms opening out of it on either side. Our sitting-room, a little ante room, & small dressing room, all give out on the fine Battery, which makes a charming walk._   
The journey had cleary exhausted her and she felt 'very tired and headacy'.

The next morning was wild and stormy but the Queen enjoyed the views of the sea, which she describes as "splendid, so close, so open, & so many ships to be seen," from her breakfast room. H.M.S. Thunderer which had fired a royal salute on her arrival was clearly visible. After breakfast, the royal party took a walk along the beach towards Dover, for about a mile, but the wind was very fierce and they returned to read and write letters. They did not see a soul on teh beach and the Queen muses: 'One is out in a moment, so different to Brighton; this is _so_ private.'
