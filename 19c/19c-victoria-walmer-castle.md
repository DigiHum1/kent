**Events with dates:** 10th Nov 1842 – 3rd Dec 1842   
_'It is the most delightful sea-residence to be found anywhere, particularly for children. They can be out all day, on the ramparts and platforms quite dry, and the beautiful gardens and wood are enclosed and sheltered from the severe gales of wind.'_ The Duke of Wellington to Sir Robert Peel in a letter written from the castle on 26th October 1842

Queen Victoria, Prince Albert and their two young children stayed at the Duke of Wellington’s residence, [Walmer Castle](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/walmer-castle-and-gardens/), in 1842. She records in her diary:
_We have settled to go to Walmer Castte on the 10th, for 10 days, as there is still scarlet fever at Brighton. The Duke of Wellington has kindly lent us Walmer. Its situation is charming, & one can see quantites of ships, which one never does at Brighton, & it has the great advantage of being private, but the house is very small, which however, will be rather fine._[^ref1]

The royal party travelled in three carriages, changing horses at Blacksheath, Dartford, Gravesend, Rochester, Sittingbourne, Ospringe, Canterbury & Sandwich during the 103 mile journey. The Queen read despatches, whilst the Prince read St Simon. She notes that the "The road was very hilly, but we came along quickly." The Duke of Wellington met them near Sandwich, accompanying them for a while before riding on to receive them at Walmer. It was dark when they arrived and the Queen observes that: 
_Most of the rooms are very oddly shaped, from forming part of a circle, the Castle being, in fact, a large Martello Tower. The Nursery is over the Moat, of course, connected, as there is one long passage, going all along, rooms opening out of it on either side. Our sitting-room, a little ante room, & small dressing room, all give out on the fine Battery, which makes a charming walk._   
The journey had cleary exhausted her and she felt 'very tired and headacy'.

The next morning was wild and stormy but the Queen enjoyed the views of the sea during breakfast, which she describes as 'splendid, so close, so open, & so many ships to be seen'. H.M.S. _Thunderer_ which had fired a royal salute on her arrival was clearly visible from the window. After breakfast, the royal party took a walk along the beach towards Dover, for about a mile, but the wind was very fierce and they returned to read and write letters. They did not see a soul on the beach and the Queen muses: 'One is out in a moment, so different to Brighton; this is _so_ private.'

The weather continued to be inclement, and on the next day they waited until the rain cleared before taking a walk along the footpath towards Deal. The Queen found the steeply shelved shingle beach difficult to walk on complaining that it was 'hard work scrambling up the bank again'. Victoria was not impressed with Deal, which she dsecribed as 'not attractive, & the country about here decidedly not pretty'.

On the Sunday, the weather was atrocious and 'dreadful pouring rain, with tremendous wind' meant they could not go out. However, on the following day, the weather broke and the royal party took a walk after breakfast.  The children played on the beach and Albert visited the Thunderer, whilst Victoria watched.  She records: 'The sea like a lake, & quite blue, & the sun shining on the white sails of the ships was lovely. I counted 80 ships, irrespective of fishing boats'.
