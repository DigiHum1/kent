## Dickens, _A Tale of Two Cities_ and France

>“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times…” (Dickens, 1875, p.1)

The opening of [Charles Dickens](/dickens/dickens-biography)’ novel _A Tale of Two Cities_, is probably one of the most famous in English literature. Set in London and Paris, the novel sets out the events leading up to, at the start of, and even predicts the end of the French Revolution. The novel very quickly moves to Kent, with the Dover Mail reaching its destination in chapter four. Dickens spent several years living at [Gad's Hill](/dickens/dickens-gads-hill) in Kent, so it is unsurprising that he was a frequent visitor to France. Dickens used France and Kent as dual settings for some of his novels – maybe his love for Kent led him to love France too.

However, his novel which made the most references to France, _A Tale of Two Cities_, was not so popular there, and does not have as many French translations as his other works. Some suppose that the book is misunderstood in the French, and the first translation may support that idea by the use of the title _Paris et Londres en 1793_  (Paris and London in 1793)[^ref1], which seems to forget the starting point of 1775 and the events preceding 1793.

In _A Tale of Two Cities_, Jarvis Lorry goes for a walk on the beach at [Dover](/dickens/dickens-dover), which is described in great detail: 
  
>The little, narrow, crooked town […] hid itself away from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine ostrich. The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was destruction. It […] thundered at the cliffs, and brought the coast down, madly. The air among the houses was of so strong a piscatory flavour […]. A little fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by night… [^ref2]

This is one of only a few references to [Dover](/dickens/dickens-dover). But Dickens does make reference to the Royal George Hotel where Mr Lorry stays before he leaves England. The real-life equivalent to this hotel is believed by some to be the Ship Hotel which was sadly demolished the year after Dickens published _A Tale of Two Cities_.[^ref3] Dickens stayed in this hotel in 1856 and this hotel was also frequented by other literati such as Lord Byron.[^ref4] For a time, this hotel bore a name slightly more similar to the one Dickens chose, when it was known as The Royal Ship Hotel.[^ref5]

Very early on in the novel, Dickens refers to the Dover Mail which would have arrived from London in Dover at six in the morning, having left Dover on the journey to London at eight the previous evening.  It certainly seems from Dickens’ description of the postal service that he was describing the coach travelling from London in the early hours of the morning. Furthermore, his description of the passengers’ unwillingness to trust one another seems to reflect the dangerous nature of journeys reported in news articles from 1775, of robberies where highwaymen stopped coaches on their way into towns.[^ref6] The journey between Dover and London was a fairly popular one, which meant coaches made the journey everyday excepting Sundays.[^ref7] In Dickens’ description of the journey near Shooters Hill, however, it does not sound like a pleasant one:

>He walked uphill in the mire by the side of the mail […] because the hill, and the harness, and the mud, and the mail were all so heavy, that the horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath […] There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do.[^ref8] 
>
Dickens adds that such a journey in winter was “an achievement to congratulate an adventurous traveller upon”[^ref9] and even the condition of the coach was not something that would add comfort to such a journey, “The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp and dirty straw, its disagreeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather like a larger dog-kennel”.[^ref10]

There are several other novels that mention the journey between Kent and France, including Dickens’ story of _Little Dorrit_ which also includes the treacherous journey along the [Dover Road](/dickens/david-copperfield-dover-road/) between Dover and London, this time, by the Courier coach.
